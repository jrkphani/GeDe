// Read-path workspace scoping (issue 058) — the analogue of 057's
// `checkTenancy` on the write side: a shape subscription for a given table
// must be scoped to the caller's authorized workspace id(s), never
// table-global (design brief: "never an unscoped SELECT * that would leak
// cross-tenant rows over the read-path the way 057 closes the gap on the
// write-path").
//
// Pure/injectable — no Electric client, DB driver, or Vite import — so it is
// reachable from BOTH the browser bundle (src/sync/config.ts re-exports
// SYNCED_TABLES from here, the single source of truth for "which tables does
// this app sync") and server code (src/server/shapeProxy/handler.ts, the
// actual enforcement point). See that module's header for why the WHERE
// clause is built SERVER-SIDE, from the verified JWT's resolved workspace
// memberships, never from a client-supplied parameter — ElectricSQL's own
// documented security model (node_modules/@electric-sql/client/skills/
// electric-proxy-auth) is explicit that a client must never control a shape's
// `table`/`where`/`params`, since Electric's HTTP API has no per-request
// authorization of its own.

// Every base table this app syncs, in a stable order. Not an FK-apply-order
// requirement (src/db/sync.ts's two-pass strategy tolerates any order within
// a batch) — just the fixed list of shapes the read-path subscribes to.
// `invitations` was excluded until issue 062: a fresh, not-yet-member
// invitee has no membership row to resolve FROM, so there is no other
// delivery path for their own pending invite — see this table's email-scoped
// predicate below (`scopeToWorkspaces`'s `callerEmail` param), the one
// exception to "every shape is membership-scoped only". `workspace_members`
// was excluded for a DIFFERENT reason (056's own scope note: the shape-proxy
// resolves a caller's memberships by querying `workspace_members` directly
// server-side, see src/server/shapeProxy/albAdapter.ts — that query still
// exists and is unchanged) until issue 067: the shape-proxy's own server-side
// query was never a delivery path to CLIENTS, so the Members UI
// (WorkspaceMembers.tsx) built its list from whatever each user's own local
// PGlite happened to already contain, which diverges the moment membership
// changes on another device — 067 adds it here, membership-scoped only (NO
// email relaxation — that is invitations' own deliberate exception, not a
// general pattern; see the workspace_members tests in syncScope.test.ts).
